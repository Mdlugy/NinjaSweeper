A clone of Minesweeper built in vanilla HTML CSS and JS


This was an optional assignment at coding Dojo. 
we were provided with the css, an empty html file and the all the JS up to line 18, the rest was written by me.
the assigment was just to get the individual boxes to be clickable and show a number next to it.
I wrote the logic for that number to actually calculate how many Ninjas(mines) were adjacemt to each cell (none of that code was provided). 
I also decided to create a multiple difficulty settings as well as user defined board size.
